# Generating Affine Planes and Extending MOLS to Maximal Sequences

## Project Overview: 
This project focuses on generating affine planes and extending Mutually Orthogonal Latin Squares (MOLS) to their maximal sequence length. Affine planes are fundamental structures in combinatorial design theory and have applications in areas like coding theory, cryptography, and statistical experiment design. Mutually Orthogonal Latin Squares (MOLS) are arrangements that satisfy specific orthogonality properties, crucial for combinatorial designs. By automating the generation and extension of affine planes and MOLS, this project aims to enhance combinatorial problem-solving capabilities in these fields.

## Objectives

1. **Generate Affine Planes**: 
   Develop an algorithm to construct affine planes of a given order, following combinatorial principles. This will involve verifying the properties of affine planes, such as parallelism and coverage, and ensuring that each plane meets the requirements for affine geometry.

2. **Extend MOLS to Maximal Sequence Length**: 
   Design a system for generating MOLS of a given order and expanding them to their maximal sequence length. This includes checking for orthogonality conditions between Latin squares and exploring configurations until reaching the maximum number of MOLS for the order.

# Error Correction Algorithm for Cyclic Codes

## Project Overview: 
This project aims to explore the generation of cyclic configurations and the implementation of error correction for codes derived from these configurations. Cyclic codes are a class of linear error-correcting codes that have the property that if a codeword is in the code, any cyclic shift of that codeword is also in the code. This project will involve creating an algorithm that generates cyclic configurations based on a finite field and implements error correction capabilities for binary strings.

## Objectives

1. **Generate Cyclic Configurations**: 
   Develop an algorithm that, given a natural number `N` equal to `p^n` (where `p` is a prime number and `1 ≤ n ≤ 3`), generates cyclic configurations. This will involve constructing a difference set in the additive group of a finite field with `N` elements.

2. **Implement Error Correction**: 
   Create functionality to correct errors in binary strings provided as input. The program should be able to identify errors in the input strings based on the cyclic code properties and correct them if possible. If correction is not feasible, the program should indicate this.

3. **Validate Input and Output**: 
   Ensure that the program can handle edge cases such as invalid input for `N` and correctly report the status of error correction attempts. This includes implementing clear error messages and informative outputs for users.

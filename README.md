# Algorithms and Discrete Mathematics

This repository contains small projects focused on various topics in algorithms and discrete mathematics. Each project addresses specific mathematical concepts and algorithms, providing implementations and analyses.

## Projects Overview

1. **Generating Affine Planes and Extending MOLS to Maximal Sequences**
   - This project focuses on generating affine planes and extending mutually orthogonal Latin squares (MOLS) to maximal sequences, contributing to combinatorial design and discrete mathematics.

2. **Investigating the Difference Between Algebraic Connectivity and Vertex Connectivity**
   - This project explores the differences between algebraic connectivity and vertex connectivity in graph theory. It includes theoretical insights and practical implementations to compare these two important metrics.

3. **Error Correction Algorithm for Cyclic Codes**
   - This project implements an error correction algorithm for cyclic codes, which are widely used in digital communications. The implementation covers encoding, decoding, and error detection processes.
